Data science end-to-end scenario that build and running on cloud platform

The lifecycle of a Data science project typically includes (often, iteratively) the following steps:
1. Business understanding
2. Data acquisition
3. Data exploration, cleansing, preparation, and visualization
4. Model training and experiment tracking
5. Model scoring and generating insights.
   
The goals and success criteria of each stage depend on collaboration, data sharing and documentation. The Fabric data science experience consists of multiple native-built features that enable collaboration, data acquisition, sharing, and consumption in a seamless way.
